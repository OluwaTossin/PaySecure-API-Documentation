# Getting Started with PaySecure API

This guide will help you set up and begin using the PaySecure API for secure payment processing.

## Prerequisites
- PaySecure account with API access
- API key generated from the PaySecure dashboard
- Basic understanding of RESTful APIs
- Development environment with internet access

## Installation & Setup
1. **Sign Up:** Register for a PaySecure account at [PaySecure Registration](https://paysecure.com/register).
2. **API Key Generation:** Follow the steps in the [Authentication](./authentication.md) guide to generate your API key.
3. **Environment Setup:**

   - Set your API key as an environment variable for security.

## First API Request Example
```python
import requests

url = "https://api.paysecure.com/transactions"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key_here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

## Next Steps
